# Hey! I'm Tyler Hilker üëã

I get pumped about shaping perspectives and systems in order to overcome challenges and make the most of opportunities. I‚Äôm often addressing alignment issues, scratching itches, & learning how to slow down faster.

I‚Äôve got an amazing wife, four kids, two dogs, and four cats. We live on a big yard where we grow various fruits, vegetables, & hops. 

I‚Äôm one who hopes in Jesus but struggles greatly to consistently live into that reality; I‚Äôm thankful for grace & small wins. 

As the¬†VP of Strategy¬†at¬†[Crema](https://www.crema.us/) ‚Äî a¬†design & technology consultancy in Kansas City ‚Äî I help find, shape, and unlock opportunities for people, teams, and products. 

You can find me elsewhere, too:¬†[X,](https://x.com/thehilker?s=21&t=hsxEnviB74VyrsVp6DZTxg)¬†[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerhilker?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=ios_app), [Medium](https://medium.com/@thehilker), [Farcaster](https://warpcast.com/trh), and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/thehilker).

## Some ideas I play around with

**Asymmetric Attention** is the phenomenon of unintentionally minimizing the work and contribution of others. It‚Äôs like seeing their work through a keyhole,¬†assuming that whatever we can see through that keyhole is all that exists or all that matters when in reality, the space is much larger. This underneath why we ask others, ‚ÄúHow hard can it be?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you just do‚Ä¶?‚Äù 

**Collect the dots; connect the dots** is a simple phrase to remind myself that both mindsets are required for great work.

**Organizational Overhead** is the cost of working in or with any organization. Politics, processes, systems, technology, etc. 

**Distribution multiplies distribution** means that as a product adds users, it will field exponentially more and a broader variety of requests to meet the needs of said users.

## **Some things I like**

**[Levi‚Äôs 511 jeans](https://www.levi.com/US/en_US/jeans-by-fit-number/men/jeans/511/c/levi_jeans_by_fit_number_men_jeans_511)**
Comfortable and inexpensive enough to not care about them getting ruined.

**Diner-style mugs**
It‚Äôs the right size (an even 300ml of coffee, with an even 20g of grounds), sits well in your hands, and has nice insulative properties. I look for them in every coffee shop and have a rather large collection.

**[OXO Pourover](https://www.oxo.com/pour-over-coffee-maker-with-water-tank.html)**
Of all the brewing methods, this is my daily go-to for two reasons: Pour the water all at once and find the filters anywhere. The plastic is great for our house and ideal for camping. I prefer Central & South American, Indonesian, & darker roasted coffees, but I‚Äôll drink almost anything.

**[Leuchtturm Classic Notebook](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/classic-notebooks-1.html)**
The feel of this paper is outstanding. The shade of gray dot is perfect; it‚Äôs supportive if I want structure, but not so visible that it interrupts freeform sketches.

## **Sharing with other folks**

Having lived through a handful of somewhat interesting experiences, I‚Äôve been invited several times to share what I‚Äôve learned with about a range of topics. Design, product, leadership, faith and work, or a combination of such. Some areas I‚Äôve

Over the years, these are the resources I‚Äôve often and referenced into raggedness. They‚Äôve shaped how I approach life and work in one way or another.

# Hey! I'm Tyler Hilker 👋

I get pumped about shaping perspectives and systems in order to overcome challenges and make the most of opportunities. I’m often addressing alignment issues, scratching itches, & learning how to slow down faster.

I’ve got an amazing wife, four kids, two dogs, and four cats. We live on a big yard where we grow various fruits, vegetables, & hops. 

I’m one who hopes in Jesus but struggles greatly to consistently live into that reality; I’m thankful for grace & small wins. 

As the VP of Strategy at [Crema](https://www.crema.us/) — a design & technology consultancy in the great minor Midwest metropolis of Kansas City — I help find, shape, and unlock opportunities. 

You can find me elsewhere, too: [X,](https://x.com/thehilker?s=21&t=hsxEnviB74VyrsVp6DZTxg) [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tylerhilker?utm_source=share&utm_campaign=share_via&utm_content=profile&utm_medium=ios_app), [Medium](https://medium.com/@thehilker), [Farcaster](https://warpcast.com/trh), [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/thehilker), and [Substack](https://substack.com/@thehilker?r=4xyyn&utm_medium=ios&utm_source=profile).

## Some ideas I play around with

**Asymmetric Attention**

The phenomenon of unintentionally minimizing the work and contribution of others. It’s like seeing their work through a keyhole, assuming that whatever we can see through that keyhole is all that exists or all that matters when in reality, the space is much larger. This underneath why we ask others, “How hard can it be?” or “Why don’t you just do…?” 

**Collect the dots; connect the dots**

A simple phrase to remind myself that both mindsets are required for great work.

**Organizational Overhead**

The cost of working in or with any organization. Politics, processes, systems, technology, etc.

## **Some things I like**

**[Levi’s 511 jeans](https://www.levi.com/US/en_US/jeans-by-fit-number/men/jeans/511/c/levi_jeans_by_fit_number_men_jeans_511)**
Comfortable and inexpensive enough to not care about them getting ruined.

**Diner-style mugs**
It’s the right size (an even 300ml of coffee, with an even 20g of grounds), sits well in your hands, and has nice insulative properties. I have a collection of yet-to-be-determined size.

**[OXO Pourover](https://www.oxo.com/pour-over-coffee-maker-with-water-tank.html)**
Of all the brewing methods, this is my daily go-to for two reasons: Pour the water all at once and find the filters anywhere. The plastic is great for our house and ideal for camping. I prefer Central & South American, Indonesian, & darker roasted coffees, but I’ll drink almost anything.

[**Leuchtturm Classic Notebook](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us/classic-notebooks-1.html)**
The feel of this paper is outstanding. The shade of gray dot is perfect; it’s supportive if I want structure, but not so visible that it interrupts freeform sketches.

## **Sharing with other folks**

Having lived through a handful of somewhat interesting experiences, I’ve been invited several times to share what I’ve learned with about a range of topics. Design, product, leadership, faith and work, or a combination of such. Some areas I’ve

## Noteworthy Resources

Over the years, these are the resources I’ve often and referenced into raggedness. They’ve shaped how I approach life and work in one way or another.
